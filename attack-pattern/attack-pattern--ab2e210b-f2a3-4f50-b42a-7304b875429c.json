            "description": "Some operating systems will sometimes use a form of \"lazy writing\" for disk I/O, which may obscure the true provenance of the write operation. This method occurs when code intentionally forces the operating system to perform a lazy writing operation. For example, in Windows, a file may be opened, memory mapped, and closed, but the memory map will still exist and can be written to, which will cause a lazy write that looks like it is coming from the System process.",
