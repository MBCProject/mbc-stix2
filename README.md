# Malware Behavior Catalog Expressed in STIX 2.1 #

*The Malware Behavior Catalog has been expressed in STIX 2.1 JSON using the STIX 2.1 Committee Specification 03 (CS03).*

## Malware Behavior Catalog ##

The Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) is a catalog of malware objectives and behaviors, created to support malware analysis-oriented use cases, such as labeling, similarity analysis, and standardized reporting. Please see the [FAQ](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/master/yfaq/README.md) page for answers to common questions.

## STIX ##

[Structured Threat Information Expression](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/) (STIX) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI). STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another, including malware analysis information, in a consistent and machine-readable manner.

## MBC and STIX ##

Details on how MBC data maps to STIX 2.1, as well as information on how to query and manipulate MBC data and how to use the MBC Content in the [ATT&CK® Navigator](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator), is given in [USAGE.md](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-stix2/blob/master/USAGE.md).
