                "description": "Malware may install itself in areas other than the hard drive [1]. Other possible locations include the BIOS/Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware, which is embedded on a chip on the motherboard, and the graphics processor unit (GPU), where malware is stored in its memory buffer (also known as VRAM) [2][3]. Volatile memory is a third possibility and when installation occurs here, malware is known as \u201cfileless.\u201d \n\nWhile the definition of fileless malware can be ambiguous, here it represents malware that lives in memory only, not on disk, and it does not preclude fileless malware from using files on the system. Microsoft and Zeltser have addressed  this ambiguity by providing more context in [4] and [5], respectively.",
