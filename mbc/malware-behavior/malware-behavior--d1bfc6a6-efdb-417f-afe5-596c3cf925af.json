This is also known as a Man-in-the-Middle(MIM) attack. This manipulation is reflected by activities such as data theft (e.g., credential harvesting) and injection of unwanted ads into websites. The former can be accomplished through installation of a fraudulent certificate, enabling interception of encrypted or unencrypted data. Malicious code executed in a MIM attack has also been credited with strategic redirection of web traffic, manipulation of a victim\u2019s browsing experience, and code injection [[1]] (#1). \n\nThe related **Data Manipulation: Transmitted Data Manipulation ([T1565.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002/))** ATT&CK sub-technique was defined subsequent to this MBC behavior.",
