Code virtualization selects specific parts of original executable code and transforms them \u201cto bytecode in a new, custom virtual instruction set architecture (ISA)\u201d[1].  As explained further in [1], \u201cAt execution time, the bytecode is emulated by an embedded virtual machine (or interpreter) on the real machine. The new ISA can be designed independently, and thus the bytecode and interpreter greatly differ from those in every protected instance. In this way, the program\u2019s original code never reappears.\u201d \n\nWhile malicious actors can create a custom VM-based obfuscator as observed in Wslink [2], other options are available to them such as Themida, a commercial tool, and VMProtect, an open source tool.",
