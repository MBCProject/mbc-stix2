The malware will also lie dormant during incident reporting processes. To check whether malware has registered for login events, check the registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWinlogonNotify. If a subkey with any name exists and it has a \"shutdown\" value then the dll in the \"DLLName\" key will be launched during the shutdown process.",
