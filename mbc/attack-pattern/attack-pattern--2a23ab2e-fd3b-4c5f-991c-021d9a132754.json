Notes on ATT&CK's sub-techniques in the context of [[1]](#1) are as follows:\n\n|ID|ATT&CK Sub-Technique|Notes|\n|---|---|---|\n|E1055.001|Dynamic-link Library Injection|Malware creates a thread using CreateRemoteThread (or NtCreateThreadEx, RtlCreateUserThread) and LoadLibrary. The path to the malware's malicious dynamic-link library (DLL) is written in the virtual address space of another process; the malware ensures the remote process loads it by creating a remote thread in the target process. This is one of the most common process injection methods. Called *Classic DLL Injection via CreateRemoteThread and LoadLibrary* in [[1]](#1).|\n|E1055.002|Portable Executable Injection|Malware copies its malicious code into an existing open process and causes it to execute via shellcode or by calling CreateRemoteThread (instead of passing the address of the LoadLibrary). Called *Portable Executable Injection* in [[1]](#1).|\n|E1055.003|Thread Execution Hijacking|Malware targets an existing thread of a process, avoiding noisy process or thread creations operations. Called *Thread Execution Hijacking* in [[1]](#1).|\n|E1055.004|Asynchronous Procedure Call|Malware may leverage Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC) to force another thread to execute its code by attaching it to the APC Queue of the target thread (using QueueUserAPC / NtQueueApcThread); also called AtomBombing [[3]](#3). Called *APC Injection and AtomBombing* in [[1]](#1).|\n|E1055.011|Extra Window Memory Injection|Malware may inject into Explorer tray window\u2019s extra window memory. Called *Extra Window Memory Injection* in [[1]](#1).|\n|E1055.012|Process Hollowing|Instead of injecting code into a program, malware can upmap (hollow out) legitimate code from memory of a target process, overwriting it with a malicious executable. Called *Process Hollowing* in [[1]](#1).|\n\nMethods not captured by ATT&CK Process Injection sub-techniques are listed below. Note that IAT hooking and inline hooking (aka userland rootkits) are defined as methods under the [Hooking](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/v2.3/credential-access/hooking.md) behavior.",
