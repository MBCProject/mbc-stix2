Directories or file might be counted. If there is no human activity, the machine is suspected to be a virtualized machine and/or sandbox. Other items used to detect a user: mouse clicks (single/double), DialogBox, scrolling, color of background pixel . This method is similar to ATT&CK's [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: User Activity Based Checks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/002/) sub-technique.",
