            "description": "All command and control malware use implant/controller communication. The methods listed below can be used to capture explicit communication details. Remote file copy behavior is captured separately, as is done in ATT&CK - see **Ingress Tool Transfer ([E1105](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/v2.3/command-and-control/ingress-tool-transfer.md))**.\n\nCommand and Control Communication relates to *autonomous* communications, not explicit, on-demand commands that malware provides to an adversary (such commands should be captured with [Remote Commands](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/v2.3/execution/remote-commands.md) under the Execution objective).\n\nAs \"server\" and \"client\" are confusing terminology, we use the terms \"controller\" and \"implant\". The controller is the software running on adversary-controlled infrastructure and used to send commands to the implant. The implant is the software running on victim-controlled infrastructure that receives commands from the adversary, executes those commands on the victim, and optionally sends the results back to the adversary.",
